              <h2>About Ketchup</h2>
              <p>
                The earliest known form of Ketchup was a fermented fish sauce
                from southern China. It made its way to Malaysia and Indonesia
                where it became kecap (pronounced "kay-chap"). That word evolved
                into ketchup in English. Originally, recipes used egg whites,
                mushrooms, oysters, grapes, mussels, or walnuts, among other
                ingredients, but now the unmodified term usually refers to
                tomato ketchup.

              <h2>History of Ketchup</h2>
              <p>
                Ketchup has a fascinating history that spans the globe. Various
                recipes for ketchup were published in the 18th century, with
                ingredients including mushrooms, oysters, and fruits. However,
                it was in the 19th century that tomato ketchup began its rise to
                condiment fame. It was popularized in the United States by
                entrepreneurs such as Henry J. Heinz and quickly became a staple
                in homes and restaurants alike.

              <h2>Ketchup Manufacture</h2>
              <p>
                Modern ketchup is sweet and tangy, typically made from tomatoes,
                sweetener, vinegar, and seasonings. These ingredients are
                blended together and cooked slowly to achieve a rich, flavorful
                sauce. The tomatoes used in production are often ripe and of
                high quality, to ensure the best flavor. The resulting product
                is then bottled and distributed around the world.

              <h2>Ketchup Variants</h2>
              <p>
                Beyond tomato ketchup, there are many variants of this beloved
                condiment. For example, mushroom ketchup is a traditional
                British condiment made from cooked, salted mushrooms. Fruit
                ketchup, popular in the Philippines, is made from bananas.
                There's also a spicy version of ketchup, often paired with fast
                food or used as a base for other sauces.
